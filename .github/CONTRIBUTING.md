# Issues

We use GitHub issues to manage bugs. Please be sure that your bug description is clear
and has sufficient information so we can reproduce it !

The absolute best way to report a bug is to submit a pull request including all the details that describes the bug. When the bug is fixed, your pull
request can then be merged!

The next best way to report a bug is to provide a reduced test case on jsFiddle
or jsBin or produce exact code inline in the issue which will reproduce the bug.

# Code of Conduct

Be nice and polite with everyone. You may not be in the mood or you may think a question/request is dumb but that's probably your personal opinion on the topic.
We are here to develop nice components and share our knowledge, so stay calm and be patient. It will benefit everyone in the long run.
